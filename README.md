# YETI Chat Bot

Most of these bots require cookies from a logged in account.

For firefox:
use the cookies.txt extension
open the page you need cookies from and save the cookies for that site
update the pickler.py to convert the cookies for that txt file to .pkl
update the call from the chatbotscraper to use the .pkl file

also, you'll need to update the geckodriver location on your machine.
